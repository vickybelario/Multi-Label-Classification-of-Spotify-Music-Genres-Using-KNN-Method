# Multi-Label Recommendation of Spotify Music Genres Using Content-Based Filtering

# Introduction
The project focuses on developing a multi-label recommendation system to categorize Spotify music tracks into multiple genres using the content-based method. In todayâ€™s vast music streaming ecosystem, accurately recommendating tracks into genres helps improve user experience by providing better recommendations and playlist suggestions.

# Background
Spotify offers a diverse range of music genres and subgenres. Traditional genre recommendation models often handle single-label recommendation, where each track is associated with only one genre. However, music tracks often belong to multiple genres simultaneously. This project addresses this challenge by employing a multi-label recommendation approach with the content-based approach  to recommend music tracks into several genres.

# Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create an efficient multi-label recommendation model that can accurately predict multiple genres for a given music track. This model will be built using the content-based techniques , a simple yet effective method for recommending tasks.

# Objective
- Data Collection: Gather a dataset of Spotify music tracks, including features such as tempo, danceability, energy, and other audio features relevant to genre recommendation.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for multi-label recommendation.
- Model Development: Implement the content-based filtering to recommend music tracks into multiple genres.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the content-based model using appropriate evaluation metrics for multi-label recommendation, such as F1 score
- Results Interpretation: Analyze the results to understand the strengths and limitations of the content based approach for multi-label music genre recommendation.
- Documentation and Reporting: Document the process, results, and insights gained from the project, providing a clear guide for future improvements and applications.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information on songs/tracks (100 per year) from Top Hit playlists from 2010 to 2023 created by Spotify.

- 2400 attributes
- 23 variables
- 2 playlist related (playlist_url, year)
